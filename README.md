## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Analysis Questions

This analysis uses specific KPIs to evaluate ad performance across various social media platforms and focuses on data cleaning, performance evaluation, and summarizing key metrics with pivot tables. Below are the main analysis questions:

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- **Q1: Text-to-Column Requirement in TikTok Data**  
  Identify which columns in the TikTok data required splitting using the Text-to-Column function. Document the steps taken to clean and prepare the data for analysis, ensuring consistency and accuracy.

- **Q2: Error Patterns in Meta Data**  
  After cleaning the Meta data, observe any patterns or errors that required correction. Document these patterns and the adjustments made before proceeding with further analysis.

### 2. Performance Evaluation

- **Q3: CTR Evaluation in Meta Data**  
  Using the Meta data, apply an IF statement to evaluate the Click-Through Rate (CTR) of each campaign. Determine the percentage of campaigns that had a "Good" CTR, defined as a rate above 2%. This insight helps gauge the effectiveness of campaign engagement.

- **Q4: Low Engagement Campaigns on Snapchat**  
  Use the NOT function to identify campaigns on Snapchat with low engagement, specifically those with fewer than 1,000 clicks. Document the total number of campaigns flagged for low engagement and discuss potential implications for campaign strategy.

### 3. Pivot Tables

- **Q5: CTR by Campaign Name in TikTok Data**  
  Create a Pivot Table from the TikTok data to sum impressions and clicks by campaign name. Identify the campaign with the highest CTR and hypothesize reasons for its success, considering factors like target audience, ad format, or content type.

- **Q6: Conversion Rate by Age Group in Meta Data**  
  From the Meta data, create a Pivot Table to analyze ad performance across different age groups. Identify the age group with the highest conversion rate and discuss how this insight could guide future ad targeting and content strategies.
